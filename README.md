See "watch this.gif" for an idea of how it might look in action!

Also if you download the "text generator.exe" file, Windows verly likely will try not to execute it, since it doesn't 
trust the source. If you want to execute it either way, you have to click on "_Further information_" that then lets
you execute the .exe nonetheless.

Windows only shows me this error with the .exe if I download the file from the repository on GitHub and not when I
execute the one I locally generated from the .py file, guess I just have to live with that.
